# EDEN: The Ethical Data Exchange Network

## Vision:

We believe in a future where supply chain data producers are recognized, respected, and rewarded for sharing information and collaborating with one another.

## Mission:

We re-connect decentralized supply-chains with anti-fragile tools that protect data ownership, enable claims validation, and reward product information exchange.

## Ethical Statement:

Our solutions support and promote ethical parameters as set in the (upcoming) *Ethical Statement and Contract* of the **Ethical Data Alliance** (url upcoming).

## Executive Summary: 

We are building a decentralized public data commons. EDEN is an open protocol and API enabling the decentralized exchange of data and notarized claims from any network organization participants.
